summary: |
  Asset Key Thief was a Google Cloud 
  privilege escalation vulnerability that enabled Google Cloud 
  principals with the Cloud Asset Viewer role (or other roles 
  with the `cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources` permission) on the 
  Cloud Asset Inventory API at the Project, Folder, or Organization level 
  to view and exfiltrate any user-managed Google Cloud Service Account 
  private key under a project within the Google Cloud environment that 
  had been created or rotated up to a maximum of 12 hours ago.

  Access to Service Account private keys enable the full assumption 
  of that Service Account's identity and privileges, which would have given 
  attackers a persistent and reliable method for abusing a Google Cloud environment.
manualRemediation: |
  Consider rotating user-managed Service Account keys.
  Search for anomalous Service Account activity.
  Audit principals with access to the "cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources" permission.
  Search for "google.cloud.asset.v1.AssetService.SearchAllResources" ADMIN_READ data access logs.
